# projectJS
Project JS is a website where ypu can find a "home" page that contains a image slider, a posts section and functional login, also has a "clock" page where ou can find  a realtime clock, also has a "contact" page with a contact form and finally there is a "about" page.

This is a personal project in which I built a website using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Jquey and some pulgins like Moment.js, a form validator, a slider to display images, etc.
