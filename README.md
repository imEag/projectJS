# projectJS
Project JS is a website where you can find a "home" page that contains a image slider, a "posts" section and a functional login, also has a "clock" page where you can find a realtime clock, also has a "contact" page with a contact form and finally there is an "about" page.

This is a personal project in which I built a website using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Jquery and some pulgins like Moment.js, a form validator, a slider to display images, etc.
